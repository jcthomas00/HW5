# Anime Trivia Game

This is a timed, web-based, anime-themed trivia. Questions are retrieved in the relevant category from triviaDB API. JQuery's `getJSON` method is used to get the trivia data. The app uses Javascript's setInterval method to countdown the number of seconds remaining. The countdown is displayed as a dissappearing circle, which was made using Canvas and SVG.
